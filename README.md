**Program-1.py**: 
  Implements a simple calculator using a class that performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Takes inputs `a`, `b` as doubles, and an operation type as a string.

- **Program-2.py**: 
  Generates a series of the first `x` odd numbers starting from 1. For example, if `x = 3`, output will be `1, 3, 5`.

- **Program-3.py**: 
  Similar to Program-2, but output length depends on the parity of input. It prints odd numbers up to input `x` but only for odd values of `x`.

- **Program-4.py**: 
  Takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the key is from 1 to 9 and the value is the count of numbers in the list divisible by
